## Video Game Design Project Update #1
[ TARSURVIVAL Update #1 ]
- Worked Asset: Tilemap
- Tilemap?: Unity's Tilemap system makes it easy to create and iterate level design cycles and allows artists and designers to rapidly prototype when building 2D game worlds.

## Video Game Design Project Update #2 
[ TARSURVIVAL Update #2 ]
- Worked Assets: Tilemap, Character
- Character?: A game character is a person, character, or any other entity acting in a game.
- Description: Character Movements and Interactions were mainly explored in this update with continuing development on TileMap.

## Video Game Design Project Update #3 
[ TARSURVIVAL Update #3 ]
- Worked Assets: Tilemap, Character Animation
- 2D Animation / Sprite Animation?: Sprite Animations are animation clips that are created for 2D assets. There are various ways to create Sprite Animations. One way is to create them from a Sprite Sheet, a collection of Sprites arranged in a grid. The Sprites are then compiled into an Animation Clip that will play each Sprite in order to create the animation, much like a flipbook. Sprite Animations can also be created by using keyframe animation in Unity, via the Animation window.  
- Description: Character Movements and Animations were mainly explored in this update with continuing development on TileMap.

## Official Description
This course covers video game design, implementation, and evaluation essentials. Students will
work on semester-long projects to develop and present a complete, full-featured game. Topics
will include game rules and mechanics, video game software structure, development of art and
asset, animation, interaction, playtesting, and related coding knowledge. Prereq: CMS 250 (or
CMS 270).

Students will at first work on individual game projects. Later they will form a group and work on
semester wide group game development project. Based on the total student distribution, equal
membered group will be formed. All the groups will open their own public shared Git repository
and must name them as “CMS395-Fall2023”. Every group should come up with their very own
gaming ideas. They are welcome to check other groups Git repos for motivation. Inter-group
collaboration is totally acceptable and encouraged. Help from available AI and search tools are
also accepted. Whenever use others works such as story, coding, drawings, sounds etc. give them
credit by citing the work in the final report.


## Learning Outcomes
1. Design and develop 2D video games using Unity platform.
2. Learn essentials of video game design, implementation, and evaluation.
3. Learn C# scripting to write custom code to control game behavior, interactions, and logic.
4. Evaluate and use appropriate methods and professional standards in computing practice.
5. Communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
6. Work effectively as part of a team to develop and deliver quality software artifacts.
